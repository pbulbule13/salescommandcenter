## Tips for Best Presentation

### Before You Present

1. **Practice 3 times** with the HTML presentation
2. **Time yourself** (should be 12-15 minutes)
3. **Test on presentation screen** (resolution, colors)
4. **Have dashboard demo ready** (backup plan)
5. **Prepare Q&A responses**

### During Presentation

1. **Speak confidently** - you have the data
2. **Maintain eye contact** - don't read slides
3. **Use the numbers** - 680% ROI, $18M loss, etc.
4. **Tell Sarah's story** (A Day in the Life slide)
5. **End with clear ask** - investment, partnership, or pilot

### Common Questions (Be Ready)

**Q: "How is this different from Salesforce Einstein?"**
A: "Einstein analyzes. We execute. We create transactions, not just insights. Plus we're voice-first."

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
A: "Draft-review-approve workflow. AI proposes, human approves, system executes. You're always in control."

**Q: "How long to implement?"**
A: "2 weeks initial setup, 15 minutes training. Compare that to 6 months for traditional BI tools."

**Q: "What's your competitive moat?"**
A: "18-month first-mover advantage. Voice-native architecture. Proven 680% ROI. Network effects with integrations."

**Q: "When will you be profitable?"**
A: "Projecting profitability in Year 3 at $75M ARR with 25% operating margin."
