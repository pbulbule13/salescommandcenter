## Slide 2: The Problem

### Sales Executives Face Critical Challenges

**1. Data Fragmentation**

- Reactive instead of proactive decision-making
- Missing real-time opportunities

**3. Inefficient Processes**
- Complex systems require training
- Manual sales order entry is time-consuming
- 20+ minutes to create a single order

**4. Limited Accessibility**
- Desktop-only access
- Not available on-the-go
- Difficult to get quick answers

### The Cost: Lost Revenue, Slow Response Times, Frustrated Teams
