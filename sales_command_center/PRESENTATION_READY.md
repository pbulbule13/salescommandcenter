## Key Talking Points (Memorize)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"Imagine creating a $500K sales order while driving to a meeting, using just your voice, in 90 seconds. That's Sales Command Center - the world's first AI platform that doesn't just analyze, but executes real business transactions."

### The Problem (30 seconds)
"Sales leaders at mid-market companies waste 3-4 hours daily switching between 7 systems. That's $125K per manager in lost productivity. Across a $500M company, that's $18M annually."

### The Solution (30 seconds)
"We've built the first AI platform that combines four revolutionary capabilities: conversational AI, voice activation, real-time intelligence, and most importantly - transaction execution. It's not just reporting. It's acting."

### The Proof (30 seconds)
"Our beta customer, TechCorp, achieved 680% ROI in year one. They saved 75% of time on data gathering, reduced order creation from 20 minutes to 3 minutes, and generated $14.4M in additional revenue."

### The Market (30 seconds)
"The sales intelligence market is $5.2B today, growing to $12.8B by 2030. Our total addressable market is $32.9B. We're targeting 3.8% market share - $250M ARR by year 5."

### The Ask (30 seconds)
"We're raising $5M seed round at $25M pre-money valuation. Expected returns: 20x conservative, 40x base case, 60x optimistic, in 5-7 years. Strategic exit opportunities to Salesforce, Oracle, or SAP."

### Closing (30 seconds)
"In every industry, there's a moment when AI goes from 'interesting' to 'indispensable.' For sales, that moment is now. Sales Command Center is that moment. Join us."
